An attempt to read youtube live chat using only public api on godot and then display them.

First the code is a mess, fix it yourself if necessary. <b>no support</b>.
How to use? put you popup chat url on the main.gd, done. with this basicaly you can create extreme customizable chat layout.
thanks to power of godot engine anything is possible, for example at chill stream, you can make a 3D model to spawn with viewer name on it, and show the chat in the textbubble. or just make extreme/crazy effect with shader to make you livechat prettier. you imagination is the limit!

Implemented :
1. General Chat
2. Badges Text
3. Emoji
4. Handle User with no name (I wonder how they make..)
   
WIP :
1. SuperChat
2. use custom color of the chat if any (only on SuperChat. CMIIW)

Not Yet:
1. Make Custom Emoji Working

idk what else..
